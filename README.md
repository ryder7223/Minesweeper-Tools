# Minesweeper-Tools
Since I can't provide you the actual minesweeper program myself, I will instead tell you some things about it, you can look for some of these things on the internet. I got mine from a Windows XP virtual machine.

This is some text that was in the name of its ISO: `Windows XP Professional 64-bit Corporate Edition`
